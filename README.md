# **Running the Project**

I made my own data for this project and install json-server. The server needs to be run in order for the cards to load. Please run the following commands 

   - npx expo start --web
   - json-server --watch src/api/api.json --routes src/api/routes.json --port 8010

## **Challenge Overview**

The changes made to this challenge were:

- Fixing the running errors
- Added AI generated json of data
- Added AI generated images for card data
- Added a server and middleware
- Cards can be sorted by category.
- Cards can be sorted by all of the sort buttons.
- Updated button styling
